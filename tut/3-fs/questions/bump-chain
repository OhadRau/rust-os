What does the alloc call chain look like?

v.push(i) calls to the system allocator that's implemented using
the GlobalAllocator trait. In main.rs we declare the allocator as
global_allocator, so it knows that this is the one to use. When
the vector performs allocation, it calls out to GlobalAlloc::alloc
for our Allocator. This then locks the allocation mutex, unwraps
the inner allocator implementation, and calls its alloc() function.
In this case, we're implementing it as a bump allocator so this is
bump::Allocator::alloc().
