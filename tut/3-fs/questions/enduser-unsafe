Why is it a bad idea to expose unions to end-users?

It's a bad idea to expose unions because they allow the user to
reinterpret data in a way that doesn't necessarily make sense.
For example, you could interpret an int as a float or a float
as a string, neither of which make sense (unless you know what
you're doing... kinda). As a result, we want to keep these internal
where we know how the types are being used. Exposing safe interfaces
is important because it allows us to control what the user can do
and make sure they don't misuse any interfaces. Interface misuse
is a huge security flaw in many systems, because it can lead to
things like buffer overruns. It's hard to yield the same benefits in
C because C doesn't give us the tools to actually restrict what the
user can do, whereas Rust (apart from unsafe) does a pretty good
job at this.
