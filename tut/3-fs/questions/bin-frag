How could you decrease your allocatorâ€™s fragmentation?

1. Right now, during allocation we always pick the first
block that's compatible. By spending a little longer searching
for blocks to use, we could find blocks that are closer to
the requested alignment. This would do a great job at reducing
internal fragmentation as we would have less wasted space per
allocated block.

2. When splitting blocks, we could be more intelligent about
layout. For example, based on the alignment we could often do
a better job by either putting the returned block at the end of
the large block (reducing internal fragmentation, since the
alignments might match up better) or we could do some hand
optimization to figure out common allocation alignments and
prefer to break along those alignments (which would reduce
external fragmentation, since we would have fewer unusable
blocks).
