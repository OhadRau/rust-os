What does the CMDLINE ATAG contain?

"bcm2708_fb.fbwidth=656 bcm2708_fb.fbheight=416 bcm2708_fb.fbswap=1 dma.dmachans=0x7f35 bcm2709.boardrev=0xa020d3 bcm2709.serial=0xfe0a27f7 bcm2709.uart_clock=48000000 bcm2709.disk_led_gpio=29 bcm2709.disk_led_active_low=0 smsc95xx.macaddr=B8:27:EB:0A:27:F7 vc_mem.mem_base=0x3ec00000 vc_mem.mem_size=0x40000000  console=ttyS0,115200 kgdboc=ttyS0,115200 console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4 rootwait"

I think this specifies the hardware available (the SoCm, various features like DMA,
uart, serial, and settings for those). This is useful for implementing drivers,
because you can scan the available hardware and dynamically enable the corresponding
drivers. In addition, it gives the info needed to use some of these devices, like
memory addresses for those devices' MMIO and a MAC address.
