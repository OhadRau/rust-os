Since we can't really hope for a thread-safe API, it's up to us to
try to make the Rust implementation thread-safe. To do this, I store
a static mutex, so that we can restrict access to the SD card while
it's busy. Since there's only ever one mutex, we can be sure that two
threads can't lock the SD card at the same time. Every behavior
implemented relies on locking, so we can be sure that our code privides
a thread-safe interface.
