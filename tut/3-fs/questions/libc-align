Why did C choose these alignments?

Because of the way that caching works, it's more efficient to
fetch 8 or 16 bytes of memory and place those in the cache. Since
it's quicker to access things at the beginning of a cache cell,
it's better to align data to the byte boundaries where each cache
cell starts. In practice, this happens to be every 8 or 16 bytes.
Additionally, this allows you to take advantage of spatial locality:
if we have a struct located at a 16 byte boundary and we grab its
first few bytes, we know that the rest of the cached data will come
from the same struct (rather than whatever was before it) since we
aligned to the cache boundaries.
