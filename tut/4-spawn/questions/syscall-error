The advantage of using x7 to pass the error is that we can use the
entire register as errors AND not overload any other result registers.
For example, if we wanted to return PIDs from GET_PID in x0, we'd have
to change PIDs to always be positive so that they wouldn't get
interpreted as errors.

The disadvantage is that we lose the x7 register for passing in more
params, so we have to make syscalls take only 7 params max. This is
probably fine, but e.g. the NT kernel often uses far more args.
