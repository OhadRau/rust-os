The new state will depend on how the switch happens. If a process is
busy writing I/O, we can perform a context switch & mark it as waiting.
If it got interrupted by the timer because its quantum has expired,
then we want to mark it as ready but still perform the context switch.
Finally, if a process is killed/finished executing we want to switch
contexts and mark it as dead. Thus, the new state can be each of these
3 things and they are determined outside of the context switch, so we
need to pass that info in.
