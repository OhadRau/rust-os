One advantage of separating these is that we don't have to look thru
waiting tasks if there are already some ready, and we can only check
waiting tasks when we've exhausted the ready tasks. This speeds up
scheduling, but also leads to exhaustion of tasks with more I/O since
they spend a much longer time in the wait queue than is necessary.
We could add a task to the ready queue that handles updating the wait
queue or maybe have the tasks get moved automatically once they're
ready, but this also leads to some complications.
