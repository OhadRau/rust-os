What do the macros do?

The macros provided are used to write the repetitive
implementations for Readable/Writeable in lib.rs.
Specifically, they take a type to implement the traits
on and an expression to access the inner pointer that
the reads/writes happen on. The default definitions of
the traits then use this .inner() function to actually
perform the default operations for reads/writes. This
cuts down on a lot of code where one could easily make
some small mistakes and break all the safety of the
abstraction.
