Which tests make use of the Deref implementations?

Every test that uses the subscript notation would fail, since that
inherently requires a deref. This includes index_oob,
index_oob_after_truncate, indexing, and mut_indexing. Because of
the way that the .iter() function is defined, it also requires
the container type to implement Deref, so the following tests also
depend on the Deref trait: assignment_text_example and iterator.

For DerefMut?

The mut_indexing trait would fail, since it depends on being able
to use the subscript operator mutably, which requires a mutable
dereference of the StackVec.
