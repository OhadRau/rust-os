Why can't you write to CLO or CHI?

Using the volatile library, CLO and CHI have been marked as
ReadVolatile<u32>. I.e., they have only the read permission
and they don't implement the Write trait. In order to write
to them unsafely we'd need to get the underlying pointer
from the ReadVolatile<u32> and write to it directly using
the unsafe keyword & .read_volatile(). So without using the
unsafe features and raw pointers, it's impossible to break
this permission.
