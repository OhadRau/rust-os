What could go wrong if a client fabricates states?

If  the client could fabricate state, we could end
up with pins in unknown states -- even though the
type might say the state is ALT, it could really be
OUTPUT and we would have no way of knowing because
the state is stored in the type. At that point, the
driver would have no way of knowing what to do and
would just break.
