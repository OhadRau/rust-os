In assignment 1-blinky, you enabled GPIO pin 16
as an output and then repeatedly set and cleared
it by writing to registers GPFSEL1, GPSET0, and
GPCLR0. Which three registers would you write to
to do the same for GPIO pin 27? Which physical
pin on the Raspberry Pi maps to GPIO pin 27?

To setup, use bits the FSEL27 field (bits 21-23)
on the GPFSEL2 register. To set & clear use the
27th bit on the GPSET0 and GPCLR0 registers.

This pin maps to pin 13 on the Pi.
