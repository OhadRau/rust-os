How are read-only and write-only accesses enforced?

They enforce this by not giving a Readable/Writeable
impl, so that there's no .read/.write function that
can be called on that data type (without accessing
the underlying pointer). Since these are abstractions
that are given to safe code, you can't simply get the
underlying pointer and do a read/write that's not
permitted.
