Why does push return a Result?

Because StackVec is backed by a slice, it has a
set capacity. We can't resize the slice since it's
a borrowed stack value. As a result, when we reach
the full capacity we can't actually push anything
since that would require overwriting existing data
or accessing memory that can't safely be accessed.
We return a Result<> so that the user can interpret
whether or not the operation worked (in a standard
way).
