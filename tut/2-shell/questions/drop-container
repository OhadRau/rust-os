Why should we never return an &mut T directly?

If we return an &mut T from a function we are effectively creating
a safe mutable reference for the consumer of the function. Either
this &mut T refers to an existing piece of memory, in which case
this would allow us to create infinite mutable references to that
same memory (which breaks memory safety!). Otherwise, we would just
have to create a new piece of memory that is unused, because giving
away the mutable reference would disallow us from using it later on.

As an example, if we could keep getting new mutable consoles we could
have consoles writing over each other. This would be a form of data
race.
