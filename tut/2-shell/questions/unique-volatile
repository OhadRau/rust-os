Why does Unique<Volatile> exist?

While Volatile implements volatile read/write to
raw pointers, Unique<Volatile> adds an extra feature:
it enforces synchronous read/write so you don't have
any data races. Because the reads/writes are unsafe
you have to be careful to not read/write at the same
time and corrupt the volatile pointer's data.
