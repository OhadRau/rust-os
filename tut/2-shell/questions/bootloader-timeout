Why is the timeout necessary?

If we failed to transmit the binary correctly (some error or
interference over UART) then the receiver can cancel the
transmission or send a NAK at the end to say that the checksum
didn't match. If either of these happens, we need to retry
the transmission or else the code will never get uploaded and
we'll just jump into uninitialized memory. In this specific case
we add the timeout so that if the read isn't ready to be processed
then we'll retry after 750ms. This is because we could've missed
the start of a transmission or there could be some read failure
happening. By adding this timeout, we'll retry if the transmission
hasn't gone thru or isn't ready to happen yet.

As an example of a stall that could happen from not timing out,
imagine that the receiver misses the final packet for some reason.
In that case, it'll just keep waiting for this final packet to come
thru and never jump into the actual program. Aborting the connection
is required so that the uploader knows that it needs to reupload
the code.
