How does your shell tie the many pieces together?

The shell so far makes use of: the stack vec (command
parsing), volatile (needed for the various drivers),
gpio (through its use in UART), the UART component
(for serial input/output), the console (for reading
and writing to UART). The timer isn't currently used
but will definitely serve as an important part of the
future OS. Likewise, while we don't yet use xmodem or
ttywrite the pieces are falling in place for these
components.
