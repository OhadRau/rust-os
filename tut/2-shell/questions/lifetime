Why is the 'a bound on T required?

The 'a bound is required because the compiler needs
to know that the items stored in the slice will
live at least as long as the slice itself. This is
important because we want to be able to access the
values stored inside the backing store for the entire
time that the StackVec is alive. If this wasn't
enforced by the compiler, the items inside the store
could be dropped before the StackVec is dropped. This
would specifically become a problem when pushing a
value to the StackVec that has a shorter lifetime,
in which case it could get dropped before the
StackVec is dropped and thus leave an invalid cell
in the StackVec.
