Why does StackVec require T: Clone to pop()?

This is needed because we want to be able to continue
using the values from a StackVec after popping them. If
we didn't clone the values, we'd have to access them
through a reference out of the store after popping.
Since the StackVec is allocated from the stack, the
entire vector will get dropped at once (including the
contents) when the function that created the stack
returns. When this happens, we'd likely still want the
values to being able to clone on pop() is useful.
