What happens when a flagâ€™s input is invalid?

The structopt calls out to various parsers in the parsers.rs file.
Each argument has a specified parser that attempts to parse the
provided strings into a Result of the correct type. When a flag's
input is invalid, the parser prints out a specified error message,
which is provided as an Err() value. Otherwise, it just returns the
result.
